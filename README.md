# ABC Live API

ABC Live API is the API made for my financial news compiling app [ABC Live](https://github.com/Areen-Rath/ABC-Live). The API collects headlines with other information like description, article image and hyperlink from Moneycontrol, Economic Times and Business Line, which are then used in the app to display the news and redirect to the link by clicking on the news.

Refer to [ABC Live](https://github.com/Areen-Rath/ABC-Live), the app for which it was made.

**Note:** The original ABC Live API, which is no longer maintained, was written in Python. For ABC Live API in Python, click [here](https://github.com/Areen-Rath/ABC-Live-API-Old).
